Git is a distributed version control system. Using Git, many developers can make changes to the same code base at the same time without running into accidents like overriding someone else’s changes. Git will update only difference to a file.

**Benefits of Git

1.Simultaneous development

Everyone has their own local copy of code and can work simultaneously on their own branches. Git works when you’re offline since almost every operation is local.

2.Faster releases

Branches allow for flexible and simultaneous development. The main branch contains stable, high-quality code from which you release. Feature branches contain work in progress, which you merge into the main branch upon completion. By separating your release branch from development in progress, you can manage your stable code better and ship updates more quickly.

3.Built-in integration

Due to its popularity, Git is integrated into most tools and products. Every major IDE has built-in Git support, and many tools that allow you to manage continuous integration, continuous deployment, automated testing, work item tracking, metrics, and reporting feature integration with Git. This integration simplifies your day to day workflow.

4.Strong community support

Git is open-source and has become the de facto standard for version control, and there is no shortage of tools and resources available for your team to leverage. The volume of community support for Git compared to other version control systems makes it easy to get help when you need it.
