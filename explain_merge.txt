syntax : git merge <branch_name>

git merge command is used to combine two branches. git merge will combine multiple commit into one unified history.

merge cmmand will merge specified branch into current branch on which 
command is executed.

Merge Conflicts : git will determine the merge algorithm automatically. If git encounters any data segment that is chaged in both branch it unable to combine them automatically this is known as merge conflicts then user manually decide which change should be in merged commits.

Preparation Before Performing merge: 
1. Head should point to correct merge receiving branch. If not then chekout to receiving branch.

2.receiving branch and merging branch should be up to date with the latest remote changes. To confirm it git fetch should use to pull latest commits. 

Merged Types : 

1. Fast Forward merge : 
when two branches are lineraly connected fast and forward merge is performed in which current pointer shifted to merging branch.
if braches are diverged or not lineraly connected then fast forward is
merge is not possible.

2. When ever branches are diverged 3-way merge is perfomed in this merge a dedicated commit is performed to tie together two histories.
