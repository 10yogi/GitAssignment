The git pull command is used to fetch and download content from a remote repository and immediately update the local repository to match that content

The git pull command is actually a combination of two other commands, git fetch followed by git merge

 In the first stage of operation git pull will execute a git fetch scoped to the local branch that HEAD is pointed at

 Once the content is downloaded, git pull will enter a merge workflow. A new merge commit will be-created and HEAD updated to point at the new commit.


Pull with rebase: 
A --rebase option can be passed to git pull to use a rebase merging strategy instead of a merge commit.  

rebase pull does not create the new commit . Instead rebase copied the remote commits and appended the to local origin/master commit history
